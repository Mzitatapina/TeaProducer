    From the beginning, back in 1809, two-hundred years ago, Prince Mamia V Gurieli (1809-1826), the last ruler of the Guria principality in Western Georgia, took great interest in transforming and developing the agricultural sector.<br /> 
    Following the advice given by the French botanists Andre Michaux and his son Francois Andre Michaux, who were the first to bring the tea plant to the United States in 1799, the Prince ordered the first Tea - Camellia Sinensis samples. These were brought to his botanical garden by the Scotsman Jacob Montague Marr, together with other exotic plants. Cultivation of this once unknown plant has laid the grounds for the development of what in the following decades became one of the biggest agricultural industries in Georgia.

            The number of sunny days in Georgia, optimal average annual temperature (+12.5 C ..+14.7 C) and subtropical 
            climate contribute to the quality of tea leaves. Strong contrast between day and nighttime temperatures during

            Georgian scientist, Ksenia Bakhtadze first proved the principle that different varieties of tea could be 
            crossed to create plants with unique traits. Through the generational selection method, she managed to
